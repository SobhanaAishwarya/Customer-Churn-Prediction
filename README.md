Project Name :Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a service (churn). It helps businesses identify high-risk customers and take proactive actions to retain them.

* Features:
1.Preprocessing of real-world customer data
2.Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
3.Multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network)
4.Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
5.Visualizations for model performance

*Technologies Used:
Python,Pandas, NumPy,Scikit-learn,Matplotlib, Seaborn,imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

*Dataset
The dataset contains customer details such as tenure, monthly charges, contract type, payment method, and the churn label (Yes/No).

*Project Workflow:
1.Data cleaning and preprocessing
2.Encoding categorical variables
3.Train-test split and SMOTE oversampling
4.Model training
5.Evaluation with metrics and visualizations

*Results:
The performance of all models is compared using accuracy and other evaluation metrics. A bar graph shows the accuracy of each model.
